Features needed to release:

 * Configuration dialog for adding other solvers
 * Find/replace
 * Make dzn selection in Configuration tab work
 * Correct handling of open constraint graph windows
 * Multiple windows ("projects")
 * Handle duplicate open files
 * Save all
 * Indent/outdent selection
 * Tabs-to-spaces (without messing up the undo buffer)

Features that would be nice to have:
 * Global solver configurations stored somewhere system wide
 * Auto indent
 * Saving/loading projects (i.e. the contents of the Configuration tab + all 
   open files)
 * Detect when files change on disk (auto reload + dialog if changed)
 * Report solve time + support time outs
