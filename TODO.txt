Features needed to release:

 * Correct handling of open constraint graph windows
 * Multiple windows ("projects")
 * Handle duplicate open files
 * Indent/outdent selection
 * Basic help
 * Go to line
 * Report solve time + support time outs
 * Save all
 * Packaging
 * Detach solver (to be able to run Gecode w/ Gist)

Features that would be nice to have:
 * Auto indent
 * Column selection
 * Saving/loading projects (i.e. the contents of the Configuration tab + all 
   open files)
 * Detect when files change on disk (auto reload + dialog if changed)
 * Use mzn2fzn and implement the solutions processing internally
 * Run fzn files
 * Colour selection

Done
 * Focus
 * Make dzn selection in Configuration tab work
 * Clear output window
 * Font size
 * Tabs-to-spaces (without messing up the undo buffer)
 * About dialog
 * Click on error location to jump to position in editor
 * Configuration dialog for adding other solvers
 * Global solver configurations stored somewhere system wide
 * Find/replace
 * Font selection
