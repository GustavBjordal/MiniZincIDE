  v0.9.10
  - Disable all editing while the solver is running (avoids race conditions).
  - Fix behaviour of stop button: avoid race condition when pressing it twice,
    and signal that process has stopped when the initial SIGINT was successful.
  - Split up extra mzn2fzn command line arguments so they get passed correctly.
  - Changed behaviour of MiniZinc path input (now doesn't check for presence
    of mzn2fzn every time the cursor leaves the input box).
  - Add configuration option to use "default behaviour" when running models,
    which is to output all intermediate solutions for optimisation problems,
    and stop after one solution for satisfaction problems.
  - Fix "Add solver" dialog (sometimes the option to add solvers would
    disappear from the drop-down menu).
  - On Windows, configure Gecode/Gist to run the correct batch file.
  - Fix a crash when activating the (un)comment or go to line actions while
    on the configuration tab.

  v0.9.6
  - When killing a process (using the Stop action or timeout), send CTRL-C
    first, which allows the solver to exit gracefully. Solvers that do not
    react to CTRL-C are killed as before.
  - Fix copy/paste actions to also work in output window and to create
    rich text (including syntax colouring)
  - Avoid creating an empty .fzn file during compilation
  - Accept drag-and-drop to main window, opens dragged files
  - Quit menu action on Mac OS actually quits instead of just closing all
    open windows
  - Warn when loading large FlatZinc files
  - Assume UTF8 text encoding when loading and saving files
  - Keep selection of .dzn file in configuration tab when opening another
    .dzn file

    and unmodified (avoids opening a new window)
  - fixed a bug when right-clicking into an empty area in the project
    explorer
  - fixed a bug when renaming files (in particular data files) in the
    project explorer
  - add support for multi-line (C-style) comments in the syntax
    highlighting
  - on Mac OS, show a Window menu to make it easy to switch between
    open projects, and open all files dragged onto the dock icon
    in the same project
  - fixed the hard-coded library path for the G12 lazyfd solver
  - fixed a bug that could cause a crash when closing and re-opening
    a project
