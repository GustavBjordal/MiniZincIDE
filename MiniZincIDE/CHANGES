  v2.1.0
  - Add new bundled solvers: Chuffed, CBC, Gurobi
  - Change update check to use Google Analytics (opt-in)
  - Fix a crash in the syntax highlighter when changing documents (e.g when
    saving a previously unsaved file).

  v2.0.97
  - Update to include MiniZinc 2.0.97 beta release.
2016-07-31
  v2.0.14
  - Implement new Coursera submission system.
  - Reload list of data files after removing a file through the project view,
    and use persistent indices to fix file removal. Fixes #11.
  - Fix renaming of files through the project explorer. Renaming should now
    work using the usual platform editing key, and using the context menu
    option. Fixes #12.
  - Don't add empty file name to list of data files when user cancels file
    dialog. Fixes #13.
  - Add same leading white space as on current line when pressing return
    (maintain indenting).
  - Add support for new Qt WebEngine framework (since Qt WebKit is not available
    in Qt 5.6).

  v2.0.13
  - Flush output more consistently when process finished, hopefully
    fixing problem where solutions were missing from output.
  - Updated to include MiniZinc 2.0.13
2016-02-26
  v2.0.12
  - Fix link to MiniZinc issue tracker.
  - Add configuration option to clear solver output for each run.
  - Remember whether previous run used data file or manual data input.
  - Updated to include MiniZinc 2.0.12
2016-01-15

  - Updated to include MiniZinc 2.0.11

  - Fix version number comparison to work for multi-digit minor and patch
    versions.
2015-10-19
  v2.0.8
  - Only disable the run and compile actions when a solving process is currently
    running (keep editor and rest of the user interface enabled).
  - Keep editor font setting synchronised across different IDE windows.
2015-10-06
  v2.0.7
  - Changed version number scheme to coincide with MiniZinc version.
  - Disable all editing while the solver is running (avoids race conditions).
  - Fix behaviour of stop button: avoid race condition when pressing it twice,
    and signal that process has stopped when the initial SIGINT was successful.
  - Split up extra mzn2fzn command line arguments so they get passed correctly.
  - Changed behaviour of MiniZinc path input (now doesn't check for presence
    of mzn2fzn every time the cursor leaves the input box).
  - Add configuration option to use "default behaviour" when running models,
    which is to output all intermediate solutions for optimisation problems,
    and stop after one solution for satisfaction problems.
  - Fix "Add solver" dialog (sometimes the option to add solvers would
    disappear from the drop-down menu).
  - On Windows, configure Gecode/Gist to run the correct batch file.
  - Fix a crash when activating the (un)comment or go to line actions while
    on the configuration tab.
  - Avoid opening multiple "File modified" dialogs for the same file.

2015-01-10
  v0.9.6
  - When killing a process (using the Stop action or timeout), send CTRL-C
    first, which allows the solver to exit gracefully. Solvers that do not
    react to CTRL-C are killed as before.
  - Fix copy/paste actions to also work in output window and to create
    rich text (including syntax colouring)
  - Avoid creating an empty .fzn file during compilation

    project explorer

    open projects, and open all files dragged onto the dock icon
    in the same project

  - fixed a bug that could cause a crash when closing and re-opening
    a project
